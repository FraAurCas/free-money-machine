Livvy just convinced Baby Gronk to commit to LSU. Baby Gronk is the number one college football prospect in the country. He averages 300 yards and 5 touchdowns a game. On his visit to LSU, Livvy rizzed him up. Livvy even hugged Baby Gronk. He might be the new Rizz King. Do you think Baby Gronk will lead LSU to a national championship?
